Bug 1, 4, 6:
There's an out of bounds exception in Appt.java. This occured in the line
where days in month was called. The call is
(CalendarUtil.NumDaysInMonth(startYear,startMonth-1)).

Bug 2:
There appears to be an error with appt.getStartYear() not returning the
year given in the construction call.

Bug 3:
An error occurred where the description text did not match the returned
string from appt.toString() did not match the input string into the
constructer.

Bug 5:
calDay.isValid() returns false when given a valid day.

Bug 7:
timeTable.permute(LinkedList<Appt>, int[]) has an error of some kind.
("Illegal Argument Exception").
